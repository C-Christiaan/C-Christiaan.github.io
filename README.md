## Coding and Me

PHP and I have a bit of a love-hate relationship. It's a challenging journey, but overcoming each hurdle fuels my passion for coding. The dance between problem-solving and creativity is where I find my rhythm.

Currently exploring the fascinating world of Salesforce. The trial period is not just about learning the platform but also about discovering new possibilities.
